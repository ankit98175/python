# Assignment 5: Data Structures and Strings in Python

This repository contains Python programs for **Assignment 5**, covering dictionary operations and list slicing.

## 📝 Task 1: Dictionary of Student Marks

### 🔹 Description
This program creates a dictionary of student marks using **user input**.  
Student names are used as keys and their marks are stored as values.

### 🔹 How the Program Works
- The program asks the user to enter:
  - Name and marks of Student 1
  - Name and marks of Student 2
- These inputs are stored in a dictionary.
- The user is then asked to enter a student name to search.
- If the entered name is **not found**, a message is displayed.
- If the name exists, the student marks dictionary is printed.

### 🔹 Concepts Used
- Python Dictionary
- User Input (`input()`)
- Conditional Statements (`if-else`)
- Data Validation using dictionary lookup

## 📝 Task 2: List Slicing

### 🔹 Description
This program demonstrates **list slicing and reversing** in Python.

### 🔹 How the Program Works
- A list of numbers from **1 to 10** is created.
- The first five elements are extracted using list slicing.
- The extracted list is reversed using slicing.
- The program prints:
  - Original list
  - Extracted list
  - Reversed list

### 🔹 Concepts Used
- Python Lists
- List Slicing
- Reverse Slicing
